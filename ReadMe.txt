## Project Description

The **Dog Hall of Fame** is a responsive website designed to honor exceptional dogs in 
three distinct categories: **Working Dog**, **Hero Dog**, and **Companion Dog**. 
This website showcases their stories, images, and achievements in an engaging, visually appealing manner. 

Built using HTML, CSS, and modern web design practices, the website features a user-friendly layout 
that is optimized for both desktop and mobile screens. The use of vibrant colors and intuitive navigation 
ensures a smooth browsing experience for all users.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The website adjusts seamlessly for mobile, tablet, and 
        desktop devices, providing an optimal viewing experience.
- **Modern Layout**: The website features a clean, minimalistic design with a header, 
        navigation bar, content sections, and footer.
- **Interactive Navigation**: The navigation bar includes hover effects, and on mobile devices,
         it uses a hamburger toggle for easy access to the menu.
- **Image Galleries**: Each dog category (Working, Hero, Companion) has its own section with images 
        that are styled to adapt to different screen sizes.
- **Colorful and Engaging Design**: The use of gradients, vibrant background colors, and border effects 
        adds a lively and engaging feel to the site.
- **User-Friendly**: Increased font sizes, clear text contrasts, and smooth navigation make the website 
        easy to read and use.
